So I can get pretty good text output from my basic script, and I can extend that by looking back in time, possibly tying the time stamp to each of the videos that I pull images from, somehow?

I still like the idea of text on image, though. I need a good font -- something tall, medium, sans serif. Oswald-like but not Oswald.

How about keeping "remember when", but attaching different tags, like #tcot, #gamergate, #ferguson, something else like that -- especially those with a nostalgic or backward-looking sentiment.

#tbt
#nostalgia
#memories
"that time when"
also, #throwbackthursday
#oldschool
